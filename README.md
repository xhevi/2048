# 2048 vs. AI
A timed version of the 2048 game for iOS. The purpose of the game is to challenge humans into beating AI. AI has recently completed the 2048 challenge in less than two minutes. This experiment aims to check how close to that can humans get, or even better, beat AI, if possible. The game will be released to the iOS app store with a ten minutes limit and updated periodically whenever a new record is set reducing the time a human has to solve the game.
